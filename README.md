### Hi
I am working with data using statistics, machine learning & code everyday


# Thibault B. &mdash; @thibaultbl


Right now I'm working as a Machine Learning engineer in a confidential position, focused on cybersecurities challenge. 

I like to bring values using data and I am passionate about Machine Learning in production.

I participate in data science competition from time to time (top 5% at "Predict the Crude Oil production trend" by GROUPE SOCIETE GENERALE: https://challengedata.ens.fr/en/challenge/25/predict_the_crude_oil_production_trend.html, 3rd place at "Detecting Sleep Apnea from raw physiological signals" by DREEM https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/45/), but I also have a lot of things to learn outside the modeling part of data science for the moment.
