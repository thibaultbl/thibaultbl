# Thibault Blanc &mdash; @thibaultbl


Right now I'm working as a Data Scientist in a confidential position, focused on cybersecurity challenge. 

I like to bring values using data and I am passionate about Machine Learning in production.

I participated to data science competition in the past (top 5% at "Predict the Crude Oil production trend" by GROUPE SOCIETE GENERALE: (https://challengedata.ens.fr/en/challenge/25/predict_the_crude_oil_production_trend.html), but I have lot of things to learn outside the modeling part of data science for the moment.
